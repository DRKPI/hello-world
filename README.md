Practice repository

I am CS student who is trying to become more acquainted with using git.
Not sure what I like coding in yet. Have done some C#, C++, C, and Java. Java was by far the one I understood the most about but it also was the last one I learned so maybe I naturally understood more about languages. I also have done a little bit of python on my own and it seems alright. So far I don't find it any easier than other languages like I have heard.

I have also taken some web classes and learned HTML, Javascript, etc.. but I did not enjoy those classes or projects.
